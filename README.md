This is a fork of Thiago's ASME repository that will also contain all the SME R practicals, as well as an Intro to R and a bridging document for students coming into SME who already have experience with R.

Students new to R should work through intro_01 -> intro_05.
Students not new to R but joining SME from STEPH should look at sme_bridge_00.
